One of the discussion topics in my research ethics course last year was related to the ethics of (PhD) supervision. The group leading this discussion had a cool idea for having us reflect on our own situation. I *think* it was based on a research paper [^1] but I am not sure. I call it the **support-structure chart**.

The idea is that two crucial aspects of the supervision process are the amount of support and the level of structure provided by the supervisor. Different people have different expectations and requirements here (and these might change over the course of a PhD/any other type of supervised project). I think making this explicit can be helpful in terms of understanding the student–supervisor dynamic. 

This is what you do: You draw a simple coordinate system, the axes corresponding to the amount of support & structure in the supervision. It looks like this: 

{% image "./support-structure.jpeg", "A sketch of the support-structure chart." %}

Now add points in this chart corresponding to three questions:
1. What does optimal supervision look like for you?
2. What do you think would be ideal from the perspective of your supervisor?
3. What does the reality of your supervision process look like?

Bonus points for letting your supervisor answer these questions for themselves and then comparing what you came up with! One can also do this exercise with fellow students (we did it in the classroom in a group of ~15 PhD students).

I know that both "support" and "structure" are somewhat vague terms here. I think it is interesting to keep it this way and discuss differences in interpretation afterwards. But I might change my mind about this.
