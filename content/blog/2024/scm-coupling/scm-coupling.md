I started working with the EC-Earth coupled atmosphere–ocean single-column model ([Hartung et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-4117-2018)) during my [master's thesis](/research/#other).
This is a version of the [EC-Earth global climate model](https://ec-earth.org/) which is useful for model development, particularly regarding physics parameterizations in the atmospheric and oceanic boundary layers.
In my work, I have created scripts and workflows to study the impact of different coupling algorithms on model output.
My master's thesis covers pure atmosphere-ocean coupling, we are working to include other models as well (e.g., the sea ice model [LIM3](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-8-2991-2015)).

The goal here is to make the EC-Earth AOSCM a tool for coupling algorithm development in climate models.
