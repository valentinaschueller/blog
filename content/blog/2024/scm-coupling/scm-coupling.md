I started working with the EC-Earth coupled atmosphere–ocean single-column model (AOSCM, [Hartung et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-4117-2018)) during my master's thesis.
This is a version of the [EC-Earth global climate model](https://ec-earth.org/) which is useful for model development, particularly regarding physics parameterizations in the atmospheric and oceanic boundary layers.
The goal here is to make the EC-Earth AOSCM a tool for coupling algorithm development in climate models.

I have created scripts and workflows to study the impact of different coupling algorithms on model output.
My master's thesis covers pure atmosphere-ocean coupling, right now we are working on cases including the sea ice model [SI3](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7534900).
