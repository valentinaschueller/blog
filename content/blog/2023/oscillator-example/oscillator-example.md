> *I aim to have one short summary post for each of my active/finished research projects. This is one of them.*

During my master's program in Munich, I took a seminar course on fluid-structure interaction.
My project, supervised by [Benjamin Rodenberg](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/sccs/personen/benjamin-rodenberg/), was about the order of convergence in time for coupled systems of equations.
I demonstrated how the coupling algorithm affects convergence order and energy conservation for a simple example that Benjamin came up with: coupled linear oscillators.

We published this work as part of the WCCM-APCOM 2022 conference proceedings.
